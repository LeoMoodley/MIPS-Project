# MIPS-Project
Copy the code from tbMIPSProcessor.vhd to the testbench.vhd file and then copy the code from MIPSProcessor.vhd onto the Design.vhd file. All other files, open them on the right side of the Workspace in the EDA Playground.

The testbench folder is meant for if you want to test each individual file, i.e. test ControlUnit.vhd for instance, separately. Don't include it if you want to test the MIPS Project completely.
